## Debug-Exercise
Error location is specified in commented code

# REMINDER
Debugging Tips:
- Use " /* */" to comment out a block of code
Example:
 /*
  ---- some code ----
 */
 
- You can also highling specific code to be commented out and use shortcut " CMD + / "
- Use the console provided in your browser, but do not rely on just that!
- You can type "debugger" anywhere in your code to pause your program at that specific location
- LOOK OUT FOR SYNTAX ERRORS
Many times by mistake a word was mispelled or you did not capitalize a letter where it was needed
Something we forget to close a function or use an extra curly bracket or we do not close a parenthesis
- REMEBMER TO CALL YOUR FUNCTIONS
- LOOK OUT FOR COLOR CHANGES
VS Code uses specific colors for functions, variables, etc.
